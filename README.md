### Description
This app utilizes Gradle to create a single project from multiple libraries imported as sub-projects, including a Java library, an Android library, and a Google Cloud Endpoints.  The result is a joke-telling app that has both free and paid versions available.

This project was built for the Android Developer nanodegree.

### What I accomplished in this project:

* Utilized Gradle to access seperate libraries.
* Implemented a Java library to provide jokes.
* Implemented an Android library to display jokes in a seperate activity.
* Implemented a Google Cloud Endpoints to create a local server with a webpage to display jokes when the button is clicked.
* Included free version with ads, and a paid version without.
